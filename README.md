## Introduction 

Welcome to my Journal. This is where I maintain all the posts that I have written so far . I use Hugo to generate the static sites. I have chosen the Minimal Theme to keep my blog simple and at the same time give myself the opportunity to learn to add more features to the theme in future. 

## Purpose of Journal 

My main intention of starting this journal : 
- To convert the lessons learnt so far into articles 
- To serve as a reference when required 
- To be in sync with the latest growing technology landscape 
- To share the knowledge with others.
